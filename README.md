# BERT_Multiclass_Emotion
Emotion Detection in Text hasbeen a conventionally difficult task giventhe presence of subjectivity, subtleties andstylizations used in text. While a numberof  conventional  and  deep  learning  techniques have been used, the project finds the BERT Model to be the best performing so far, and develops an application to classify text from an external dataset into the seven basic emotion classes.

The report can be found on [BERT_Based_Emotion_Recognition](https://github.com/aimanh22/BERT_Multiclass_Emotion/blob/main/BERT_Based_Emotion_Recognition.pdf)

The GloVe_LSTM_BiLSTM. ipynb contains code for models using GloVe embedding followed by LSTM and BiLSTM classifiers. The BERT_Keras.ipynb contains code for the BERT classifier.
